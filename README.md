<h1 align='center'>Hello, I'm Josh Mantei</h1>

### About Me :

I am currently studying Full-Stack Web Development at the University of Alberta. When I am not coding, I enjoy going for walks, fishing or playing guitar.

### My Skills :

So far, I have been learning the fundamentals of the front-end: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I am currently exploring front-end libraries and frameworks such as React and Astro. In the future, I look forward to learning more about the back-end by learning C# and the .NET framework.
